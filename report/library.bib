abstract = {This paper preents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobiel robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoiadance, traditionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effetively distirbuted between differnet levels of control, allowing rela-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial potential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance shceme to robot arm mechanism and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulators control problem as direct control of manipulator motion in operational space - the space in which the taks is originally described - rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. Outside the obstacle' regions of influence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit The artificial potential field approach has been extended collision avoidance for all manipulators links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint constraints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.},

abstract = {This paper concerns operational planning of door-to-door transportation systems for the elderly and/or disabled, who often need a more flexible transportation system than the rest of the population. Highly flexible, but very costly direct transportation is often offered as a complement to standard fixed route public transport service. In the integrated dial-a-ride problem (IDARP), these modes of transport are combined and certain legs of the passengers journeys may be performed with the fixed route public transport system. We extend the IDARP and include timetables for the fixed route services, forcing the fleet of vehicles to schedule the arrival at transfer locations with care. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations of the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetables are presented and analyzed. The key modeling challenge is that of the transfers between the fleet of vehicles and the fixed route public transport system. The formulations differ in how the transfers are modeled and the differences are thoroughly discussed. The computational study compares the formulations in terms of network size, computational time and memory usage and conclusions about their performances are drawn.},

abstract = {Despite the performance advantages of modern sampling-based motion planners, solving high dimensional planning problems in near real-time remains a challenge. Applications include hyper-redundant manipulators, snake-like and humanoid robots. Based on the intuition that many of these problem instances do not require the robots to exercise every degree of freedom independently, we introduce an enhancement to popular sampling-based planning algorithms aimed at circumventing the exponential dependence on dimensionality. We propose beginning the search in a lower dimensional subspace of the configuration space in the hopes that a simple solution will be found quickly. After a certain number of samples are generated, if no solution is found, we increase the dimension of the search subspace by one and continue sampling in the higher dimensional subspace. In the worst case, the search subspace expands to include the full configuration space - making the completeness properties identical to the underlying sampling-based planer. Our experiments comparing the enhanced and traditional version of RRT, RRT-Connect, and BidirectionalT-RRT on both a planar hyper-redundant manipulator and the Baxter humanoid robot indicate that a solution is typically found much faster using this approach and the run time appears to be less sensitive to the dimension of the full configuration space. We explore important implementation issues in the sampling process and discuss its limitations.},

@article{Yuksel2017,
abstract = {While visual servoing (VS) provides the ability of motion using vision for robot manipulators, the approaches for a better VS have to deal with three common problems: obtaining the interaction matrix and its pseudoinverse for defined feature points, finding an appropriate gain value for the VS controller and keeping the features in the field of view (FOV) for VS permanency. In this study, a new intelligent image-based visual servoing (IBVS) system for eye-in-hand configured robot manipulators using extreme learning machine (ELM) and fuzzy logic (FL) is proposed to solve these common problems of VS in a single system. As the first stage of the system, the pseudoinverse of the interaction matrix is approximated using trained ELMs which do not need hidden layer tuning. As the second stage, the classical IBVS controller is modified by a differential equation regarding initial velocity continuity and an appropriate gain in each loop is assigned by an FL unit to provide fast convergence within velocity limits. This unit also promotes manipulability of the manipulator to avoid singularities. As the last stage of the proposed system, regions are defined in the image plane to take precautions before feature missing. When a feature comes close to the edge of a restricted region, an FL unit is activated to obtain negative linear velocities in x and y direction which will be added to the instant velocities to drag the features towards the center of the FOV. In addition to these abilities, some VS metrics are redefined analytically to standardize the performance metric definitions of VS. To show the performance of the proposed system, simulation results of the classical and the proposed IBVS system under practical disturbances are presented for visual servoing of a Puma 560 arm. The advantages of singular matrix and joint configuration avoidance, adaptive gain with smooth gain surface, decreased convergence time within velocity limits, initial velocity continuity, FOV keeping with smooth velocity assurance, redefined VS metrics for standardization and robustness against disturbances are proved by variety of simulations. The simulation results also verify that the proposed system utilizing intelligent methods like ELM and FL is capable of dealing with common problems of VS and achieves sufficient results in terms of VS metrics.},

abstract = {This paper presents an obstacle avoidance scheme for autonomous vehicles as an active safety procedure in unknown environments. Safe trajectories are generated using the non-linear model predictive framework, in which the simplified dynamics of the vehicle are used to predict the state of the vehicle over the look-ahead horizon. To compensate for the slight dissimilarity between the simplified model and the actual vehicle, a separate controller is designed to track the generated trajectory. The longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle are controlled using the inverse dynamics of the vehicle powertrain model, and the lateral dynamics are controlled using a linear quadratic regulator. In the non-linear model predictive framework, to obtain safe trajectories, local obstacle information is incorporated into the performance index using a parallax-based method. Simulation results on a full non-linear vehicle model show that the proposed combination of model-predictive-control-based trajectory generation and tracking controller gives satisfactory online obstacle avoidance performance.},

In this work we propose a framework for markerless visual servoing on unknown objects, which is divided in four main parts: I) a least-squares minimization problem is formulated to find the volume of the object graspable by the robot's hand using its stereo vision; II) a recursive Bayesian filtering technique, based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filtering, estimates the 6D pose (position and orientation) of the robot's end-effector without the use of markers; III) a nonlinear constrained optimization problem is formulated to compute the desired graspable pose about the object; IV) an image-based visual servo control commands the robot's end-effector toward the desired pose. We demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of our approach with extensive experiments on the iCub humanoid robot platform, achieving real-time computation, smooth trajectories and sub-pixel precisions.},

Superquadrics are a family of parametric models that cover a wide variety of smoothly changing 3D symmetric shapes, which are controlled with a small number of parameters and which can be augmented with the addition of global and local deformations. The book covers, in depth, the geometric properties of superquadrics. The main contribution of the book is an original approach to the recovery and segmentation of superquadrics from range images. Several applications of superquadrics in computer vision and robotics are thoroughly discussed and, in particular, the use of superquadrics for range image registration is demonstrated.

This paper presents a fast method for testing whether two triangles embedded in three dimensions intersect. Our technique solves the basic sets of linear equations associated with the problem and exploits the strong relations between these sets to speed up their solution. Moreover, unlike previous techniques, with very little additional cost, the exact intersection coordinates can be determined. Finally, our technique uses general principles that can be applied to similar problems such as rectangle-to-rectangle intersection tests, and generally to problems where several equation sets are strongly related. We show that our algorithm saves about 20{\%} of the mathematical operations used by the best previous triangle-to-triangle intersection algorithm. Our experiments also show that it runs 18.9{\%} faster than the fastest previous algorithm on average for typical scenarios of collision detection (on Pentium 4).},

The paper uses the Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT) idea, Nd-Cuboid domains for reducing the exploration and produces new methods for path planning without having goal configuration. One method is based on pseudo-inverse Jacobian (J+) with weighted least-norm(WLN)(named here as JWLN) method which is used instead of normal J+for better behavior of the robot arm around joint limits. The second algorithm uses inverse kinematics, which help to drive the manipulator to a goal pose. The third one generates neighbor cells in Cartesian space and selects the best one for random expansion. Inverse kinematics are used in order to create a configuration for a cell. All variations are forward directed trees, since goal configuration is not present. The experiment results, done in a 7 degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot arm, show that all variations provide significant results, with the advantage to use them in grasping scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFAC.},

This is necessary for mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments that have moving obstacles with associated costs, such as personal space around people or buffer zones around dangerous vehicles. Our approach is to modify the search space used by the A* algorithm, increasing the size of grid cells further from the robot. This approach relies on the notion that only the area closest to the robot needs to be searched carefully; areas further from the robot can be searched more coarsely. Because the planner is assumed to run repeatedly as the robot moves, the robot will always have a fine-grained path defined for its next action. We have experimentally verified in simulation that this algorithm can be run in real-time and produces paths that are comparable to full-resolution planning.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to estimate the rotation and translation between two camera views from a minimum of five matched points in the images. Our approach simultaneously recovers the 3D structure of the points up to a common scale factor, and is immune to a variety of problems that plague existing methods that are based on the Euclidean homography or Essential matrix. Methods based on homography only function when feature points are coplanar in 3D space. Methods based on the Essential matrix often lose accuracy as the translation between two camera views goes to zero or when points are coplanar. By recovering the rotation and translation independently using quaternions, our algorithm eschews the shortcomings of these methods. Moreover, we do not impose any constraints on the 3D configuration of the points (such as coplanar or non-coplanar constraints). Our method is particularly well-suited for Position-Based Visual Servoing (PBVS) applications. Investigations using both simulations and experiments validate the new method. Comparisons between the proposed algorithm and the existing algorithms establish that our algorithm is robust to noise. A Matlab implementation of our algorithm is available online and free.},

abstract = {e goal configuration should be reachable through a collision free path. Generally, many con?gurations ful?ll a desired goal position, therefore a mo- tion planner should consider all possible solutions. In complex, cluttered envi- ronments it is important that a path planning algorithm considers more than one solution and exploits the redundancy of the manipulator. The proposed method considers multiple goal con?gurations by exploring the high dimensional con?guration space of a highly redundant manipulator with a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree. This approach combines the search for a goal con?guration with path planning to overcome the limitations of inverse kinematic approaches. Extending the RRT according to a heuristic guides the search tree to the goal region while avoiding con?gurations that collide with obstacles. Once the goal region has been reached, a nonlinear optimization algorithm is applied to e?ciently ?nd a configuration that minimizes the distance to the goal position. A path from initial to goal con?guration can be extracted from the generated RRT. The collision free path can now be tracked in the reaching task. The proposed path planner was thoroughly evaluated in several scenarios with different difficulty levels. Within these experiments the algorithm has successfully been used to e?ciently plan reaching motions in several scenarios.},

abstract = {With the increasing adoption of plug-in electric vehi-cles (PEVs), it is critical to develop efficient charging coordinationmechanisms that minimize the cost and impact of PEV integra-tion to the power grid. In this paper, we consider the optimal PEVcharging scheduling, where the non-causal information aboutfuture PEV arrivals is not known in advance, but its statisticalinformation can be estimated. This leads to an “online” chargingscheduling problem that is naturally formulated as a finite-horizon dynamic programming with continuous state space andaction space. To avoid the prohibitively high complexity of solvingsuch a dynamic programming problem, we provide a ModelPredictive Control (MPC) based algorithm with computationalcomplexityO(T3), whereTis the total number of time stages.We rigorously analyze the performance gap between the near-optimal solution of the MPC-based approach and the optimalsolution for any distributions of exogenous random variables.Furthermore, our rigorous analysis shows that when the randomprocess describing the arrival of charging demands is first-orderperiodic, the complexity of proposed algorithm can be reducedtoO(1), which is independent ofT. Extensive simulations showthat the proposed online algorithm performs very closely to theoptimal online algorithm. The performance gap is smaller than0.4{\%}in most cases.},

We consider the multi-vehicle Dial a ride problem, with each vehicle having capacity k and its own depot-vertex, where the objective is to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan) of the vehicles. We study the "preemptive" version of the problem, where an object may be left at intermediate vertices and transported by more than one vehicle, while being moved from source to destination. Our main results are an O(log{\^{}}3 n)-approximation algorithm for preemptive multi-vehicle Dial a ride, and an improved O(log t)-approximation for its special case when there is no capacity constraint. We also show that the approximation ratios improve by a log-factor when the underlying metric is induced by a fixed-minor-free graph.},

In dial-a-ride problems patients need to be transported from pre-specified pickup locations to pre-specified delivery locations, under different considerations. The addressed problem presents several constraints and features, such as heterogeneous vehicles, distributed in different depots, and heterogeneous patients. The aim is of minimizing the total routing cost, while respecting time-window, ride-time, capacity and route duration constraints. The objective of the study is of determining the best algorithm configuration in terms of initial solution, neighborhood and local search procedures. At this aim, two different procedures for the computation of an initial solution, six different type of neighborhoods and five local search procedures, where only intra-route changes are made, have been considered and compared. We have also evaluated an "adjusting procedure" that aims to produce feasible solutions from infeasible solutions with small constraints violations. The different VNS algorithms have been tested on instances from literature as well as on random instances arising from a real-world healthcare application.},

abstract = {We present Kinodynamic RRT*, an incremental sampling-based approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for robots with linear differential constraints. Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots (Karaman et al. 2011), by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that exactly and optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on extending RRT* to kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. Our approach can be applied to non-linear dynamics as well by using their first-order Taylor approximations. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics.},

                  {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}Pushing is one of the strategies to perform robotic manipulation when the object is too large or too heavy. Motivated by this, we address the problem of how to push an object on a plane to a target pose with two cooperating robots. The main contribution is a new uncalibrated image-based control scheme that computes the required motion of the object to reach the target pose. Then, as an application of this control scheme, we study the conditions that allow performing the task of pushing the object with two robots. The setup consists of a fixed external uncalibrated camera looking at the workspace where the object and the robots stand. The task is defined with a target image of the object in the desired pose. The proposed control scheme computes the motion commands of the pusher robots and, as a result, they translate and rotate the object by imposing non-holonomic velocity constraints. This yields smooth, continuous and efficient trajectories. The stability of the control scheme is also proven. Experiments illustrate the performance of the control scheme.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Cuevas-Velasquez2018,
abstract = {Visual servoing is a well-known task in robotics. However, there are still challenges when multiple visual sources are combined to accurately guide the robot or occlusions appear. In this paper we present a novel visual servoing approach using hybrid multi-camera input data to lead a robot arm accurately to dynamically moving target points in the presence of partial occlusions. The approach uses four RGBD sensors as Eye-to-Hand (EtoH) visual input, and an arm-mounted stereo camera as Eye-in-Hand (EinH). A Master supervisor task selects between using the EtoH or the EinH, depending on the distance between the robot and target. The Master also selects the subset of EtoH cameras that best perceive the target. When the EinH sensor is used, if the target becomes occluded or goes out of the sensor's view-frustum, the Master switches back to the EtoH sensors to re-track the object. Using this adaptive visual input data, the robot is then controlled using an iterative planner that uses position, orientation and joint configuration to estimate the trajectory. Since the target is dynamic, this trajectory is updated every time-step. Experiments show good performance in four different situations: tracking a ball, targeting a bulls-eye, guiding a straw to a mouth and delivering an item to a moving hand. The experiments cover both simple situations such as a ball that is mostly visible from all cameras, and more complex situations such as the mouth which is partially occluded from some of the sensors.},

abstract = {A new model for representing an unorganised 3D data points set is proposed. Based on superquadrics, this model allows to describe the points setwith a union of superellipsoids. Two different segmentation and modeling methods are developed in order to determine the whole model: a region growing approach and a split and merge one. This second method leads to a low sensitive model compared to the one obtained by the region growing. The model is simple and compact: only 11 parameters are needed per superellipsoid. It seems promising for 3D object compression and 3D object indexing and retrieval. As the topological relations of the superellipsoids are known, the model can be associated to a graph. The graph theory can thus be used in order to compare and to measure the similarity between 3D objects.},

abstract = {Tensor field visualization is a challenging task due in part to the multi-variate nature of individual tensor samples. Glyphs convey tensor variables by mapping the tensor eigenvectors and eigenvalues to the orientation and shape of a geometric primitive, such as a cuboid or ellipsoid. Though widespread, cuboids and ellipsoids have problems of asymmetry and visual ambiguity. Cuboids can display misleading orientation for tensors with underlying rotational symmetry. Ellipsoids differing in shape can be confused, from certain viewpoints, because of similarities in profile and shading. This paper addresses the problems of asymmetry and ambiguity with a new tunable continuum of glyphs based on superquadric surfaces. Superquadric tensor glyphs enjoy the necessary symmetry properties of ellipsoids, while also imitating cuboids and cylinders to better convey shape and orientation, where appropriate. The new glyphs are demonstrated on fields of diffusion tensors from the human brain.},

abstract = {We present an approach to path planning for manipulators that uses Workspace Goal Regions (WGRs) to specify goal end-effector poses. Instead of specifying a discrete set of goals in the manipulator's configuration space, we specify goals more intuitively as volumes in the manipulator's workspace. We show that WGRs provide a common framework for describing goal regions that are useful for grasping and manipulation. We also describe two randomized planning algorithms capable of planning with WGRs. The first is an extension of RRT-JT that interleaves exploration using a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) with exploitation using Jacobian-based gradient descent toward WGR samples. The second is the IKBiRRT algorithm, which uses a forward-searching tree rooted at the start and a backward-searching tree that is seeded by WGR samples. We demonstrate both simulation and experimental results for a 7DOF WAM arm with a mobile base performing reaching and pick-and-place tasks. Our results show that planning with WGRs provides an intuitive and powerful method of specifying goals for a variety of tasks without sacrificing efficiency or desirable completeness properties.},

abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

abstract = {The maneuvering models of motorcycles in previous studies often considered motorcycles' traveling in terms of movements in a physical static lane and not in terms of dynamic virtual lane-based movements. For that reason, these models are not able to imitate motorcyclists' behavior well. This paper proposes a maneuverability model framework for motorcycles in queues at signalized intersections with considering the dynamic motorcycle's lane. The model includes (i) a dynamic motorcycle's lane to identify the current, left, and right lanes of the subject motorcycle, (ii) a threshold distance to determine when a motorcyclist starts to consider maneuvering, (iii) a lane selection model to identify the lane preferred by a motorcyclist, and (iv) a gap acceptance model to describe whether or not the lead and lag gaps are acceptable for maneuvering. The model framework captures the variation across the motorcyclist population and over time observations. The models were applied to Hanoi and Hochiminh city, Vietnam, based on microscopic data collected from video images. All of the parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with the statistical estimation software GAUSS. The results show that 77.88{\%} of the observed maneuvers – either staying in the current lane or turning left or right – could be modeled correctly by the proposed models.},

One mechanism of enhancing sensitivity to long-wavelength light is to replace the 11-cis retinal chromophore in photopigments with 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal. Despite over a century of research on this topic, the enzymatic basis of this perceptual switch remains unknown. Here, we show that a cytochrome P450 family member, Cyp27c1, mediates this switch by converting vitamin A1 (the precursor of 11-cis retinal) into vitamin A2 (the precursor of 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal). Knockout of cyp27c1 in zebrafish abrogates production of vitamin A2, eliminating the animal's ability to red-shift its photoreceptor spectral sensitivity and reducing its ability to see and respond to near-infrared light. Thus, the expression of a single enzyme mediates dynamic spectral tuning of the entire visual system by controlling the balance of vitamin A1 and A2 in the eye.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model predictive approach for obstacle avoidance of car-like unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). An optimal tracking problem while avoiding obstacles in unknown environments is formulated in terms of cost minimization under constraints. Information on obstacles can be incorporated online in the nonlinear model predictive framework and kinematic constraints are treated by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. The overall problem is solved real-time with nonlinear programming. This approach is applied to car-like robots including tire models while explicitly considering the dimension of the UGV rather than treating it as a dimensionless cart model. Two kinds of potential-like terms are employed in the cost function for obstacles avoidance. The first term is to consider the distance between the UGV and the obstacle, and the second one is to consider the parallax information of the UGV about the obstacles. Simulation results show that both two approaches can make safe steering in a simple environment, but in a complex environment such as an urban area, the approach based on the modified parallax (MP) was more successful in the view of the computation time and safe steering.

abstract = {A representation of objects by their parts is the dominant strategy for representing complex 3D objects in many disciplines. In computer vision and robotics, superquadrics are among the most widespread part models. Superquadrics are a family of parametric models that cover a wide variety of smoothly changing 3D symmetric shapes, which are controlled with a small number of parameters and which can be augmented with the addition of global and local deformations. The book covers, in depth, the geometric properties of superquadrics. The main contribution of the book is an original approach to the recovery and segmentation of superquadrics from range images. Several applications of superquadrics in computer vision and robotics are thoroughly discussed and, in particular, the use of superquadrics for range image registration is demonstrated. Audience: The book is intended for readers of all levels who are familiar with and interested in computer vision issues.},

abstract = {We present an interactive algorithm for continuous collision detection between deformable models. We introduce multiple techniques to improve the culling efficiency and the overall performance of continuous collision detection. First, we present a novel formulation for continuous normal cones and use these normal cones to efficiently cull large regions of the mesh as part of self-collision tests. Second, we introduce the concept of ldquoprocedural representative trianglesrdquo to remove all redundant elementary tests between nonadjacent triangles. Finally, we exploit the mesh connectivity and introduce the concept of ldquoorphan setsrdquo to eliminate redundant elementary tests between adjacent triangle primitives. In practice, we can reduce the number of elementary tests by two orders of magnitude. These culling techniques have been combined with bounding volume hierarchies and can result in one order of magnitude performance improvement as compared to prior collision detection algorithms for deformable models. We highlight the performance of our algorithm on several benchmarks, including cloth simulations, N-body simulations, and breaking objects.},

Our algorithm extends the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm to cope with goals that are specified in a subspace of the manipulator configuration space through which the search tree is being grown. Underspecified goals occur naturally in arm planning, where the final end effector position is crucial but the configuration of the rest of the arm is not. To achieve this, the algorithm bootstraps an optimal local controller based on the transpose of the Jacobian to a global RRT search. The resulting approach, known as Jacobian transpose-directed rapidly exploring random trees (JT-RRTs), is able to combine the configuration space exploration of RRTs with a workspace goal bias to produce direct paths through complex environments extremely efficiently, without the need for any inverse kinematics. We compare our algorithm to a recently-developed competing approach and provide results from both simulation and a 7 degree-of-freedom robotic arm.},

abstract = {This article describes a method for reducing the number of collision checks during motion planning. The paper proposes a greedy distance computation that is a combination of Gilbert Johnson Keerthi (GJK) algorithm and Oriented Bounding Box(OBB). Two pre-computing steps are done: the calculation of maximum possible radius for each joint, used later to find the maximum curve length that the robot arm can travel in 3D space, as well as the calculation of the bounding boxes for all links and obstacles. Commonly, incremental planners need an expansion from configuration qA to qB. The new collision checking method detects for each sample in configuration space (C-Space), if the maximum length of the curve traveled from the robot in Cartesian space is bigger from the distance of the pair obstacle-robot. The new dynamic collision checking method detects near obstacles and computes only necessary distances, giving high performances. The algorithm is implemented in a 7 Degrees of Freedom(DoF) robot arm with revolute joints mounted in FRIEND rehabilitation system.},

abstract = {Collision checking is generally considered to be the primary computa-tional bottleneck in sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We show that this does not have to be the case. More specifically, we introduce a novel way of im-plementing collision checking in the context of sampling-based motion planning, such that the amortized complexity of collision checking is negligible with respect to that of the other components of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Our method works by storing a lower bound on the distance to the nearest obstacle of each normally collision-checked point. New samples may immediately be deter-mined collision free—without a call to the collision-checking procedure—if they are closer to a previously collision-checked point than the latter is to an obstacle. A similar criterion can also be used to detect points inside of obstacles (i.e., points that are in collision with obstacles). Analysis proves that the expected fraction of points that require a call to the normal (expensive) collision-checking procedure ap-proaches zero as the total number of points increases. Experiments, in which the proposed idea is used in conjunction with the RRT and RRT * path planning algo-rithms, also validate that our method enables significant benefits in practice.},

@article{Keshmiri2017,
abstract = {Understanding how species interactions shape the structure of ecological communities based on pairwise comparisons has been a difficult undertaking for ecologists because effects in reassembled communities can be different than simple density-mediated interactions would suggest. Part of this complexity occurs because many species change their behavior and morphology with different predators and competitors and, thus, change their per-capita interaction rates (i.e. trait-mediated interactions). Our objective was to use a simple experimental community of two predators (larval dragonflies, Anax longipes , and larval salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum ), two prey (larval green frogs, Rana clamitans , and larval bullfrogs, R . catesbeiana ), and a shared prey resource to determine whether we can predict interactions in a reassembled community by combining our knowledge of density- and trait-mediated interactions,. We combined pairwise laboratory experiments on predation rates and predator-induced behaviors with a mesocosm experiment to examine density- and trait-mediated effects. We used a factorial combination of no predators, caged Anax (to induce anti-predator traits without changing prey density), and lethal Anax crossed with no predators, caged Ambystoma , and lethal Ambystoma . The species interactions in the reassembled community were qualitatively predictable based on the pairwise experiments. Lethal Anax preyed upon Ambystoma and green frogs while lethal Ambystoma only preyed upon green frogs. Anax also reduced the activity of the green frogs; this caused a decrease in salamander predation on green frogs, a decrease in green frog acquisition of resources, and an increase in bullfrog acquisition of resources. Ambystoma had no effect on green frog activity, no effect on resource acquisition by green frogs, and no effect on resource acquisition by bullfrogs. These results suggest that we can better understand how species interact in natural communities if we have a more detailed understanding of trait-mediated mechanisms. However, if predicting the structure of large communities requires identifying how each species alters its traits in the presence of all other species along with altering density, improving our predictive ability may be a prohibitively large undertaking.},

The rotation carried out by a spherical joint can also be expressed by using three intersecting revolute joints that can be described using the popular Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. However, the motions of these revolute joints do not necessarily correspond to any set of the Euler angles. This paper attempts to correlate the Euler angles and DH parameters by introducing a concept of DH parameterization of Euler angels. A systematic approach is presented in order to obtain the DH parameters for any Euler angles set. This gives rise to the concept of Euler-angle-joints (EAJs), which provide rotations equivalent to a particular set of Euler angles. Such EAJs can be conveniently used for the modeling of multibody systems having multiple-degrees-of-freedom joints.},

An efficient algorithm is initially proposed for decomposing the complex objects into subobjects suitable for superquadric modeling, based on visual salience and curvature constraints. The distance between the superquadrics and the mesh is then projected onto the superquadric surface, thus generating a distance map (SQ-Map). Approximate collision detection is then performed by computing the analytical equations and distance maps instead of triangle per triangle intersection tests. Collision response is then calculated directly from the superquadric models and realistic smooth force feedback is obtained using analytical formulae and local smoothing on the distance map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SQ-Map reduces significantly the computational cost when compared to accurate collision detection methods and does not require the huge amounts of memory demanded by distance field-based methods. Finally, force feedback is calculated directly from the distance map and the superquadric formulae.},

@article{Zhang2015,
abstract = {The performance of a tracker can be measured by two often conflicting criteria - robustness and accuracy. Recently researchers have focused on improving robustness, using adaptive appearance models. However updating the appearance model can cause drift and lower the accuracy of motion (state) estimation. These trackers generally compute 2 degree of freedom(DOF) image translation of the object, and are suited for applications such as surveillance. In contrast, we are interested in tracking objects using high DOF motion models - especially 8DOF homograph models that allow tracking of precise state information (projective 8D or calibrated 3Dworld translations and 3D rotations of the tracked object). Such precise state is required for visual motion control of e.g. robot arms, hands and UAV. To this end, we propose a novel tracking algorithm that combines KLT [8], RANSAC [21] and Inverse Compositional tracker [7]. First we sample a large patch into a set of small patches and track each one using frame-to-frame 2D KLT trackers. An 8 DOF homograph describing the large patch motion is then estimated from the current locations of these KLT trackers using RANSAC while also discarding lost trackers as outliers. Finally, using the RANSAC 8DOF motion estimate as the initial guess, we perform a few iterations of an IC registration tracker. This refines the patch motion to sub-pixel accuracy and avoids drift by registering to the original template. We perform three sets of experiments - one is the standard synthetic Lena convergence benchmark and two use real image sequences from recent datasets - to show that our tracker compares favourably with the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {This paper describes a path planning technique for robotic manipulators and mobile robots in the presence of stationary obstacles. The planning consists of applying potential fields aroeund C-Space obstacles and using this field to select a safe path for the robot to follow. The advantage of using potential fields in path planning is that they offer a relatively fast and effective way to solve for safe paths around obstacles. In the method used to accomplish pathp lanning presented here, a trial path is chosen and then modifed under the influence ofthe potential field until an appropriate path is found. By considering the enire path, the problem of being trapped in a local minimum is greatly reduced, alowing the method to be used for global planning. The algorithm was tried with success on many different realistic planning problems.- The examples in this paper illustrate the algorithm applied to a two dimensional revolute manipulator, a mobile robot capable of translation only, and a rmobile robot capable of both translation and rotation.},

This paper investigates a new solution approach based on a fast gradient method in the context of model predictive control (MPC) of power converters. Different from other solution methods that either provide bounds that are far off from the practically observed ones or do not allow for bounding the computational effort at all this method enables easy to compute and meaningful bounds that can further be decreased by means of a pre- conditioning technique. We report an implementation of the fast gradient method on an industrial-type digital signal processor with integer arithmetics and show that worst case runtimes are in the order of tens of µs using less than one kByte of memory while being numerically robust. Moreover, this method also improves the control performance compared to explicit MPC.},

Dial-a-ride problem, a variant of vehicle routing problem (VRP), deals with the allocation of customer requests to vehicles, scheduling the pick-up and drop-off times and the sequence of serving those requests by ensuring high customer satisfaction with minimized travel cost. In this paper, we propose an improved tabu search (ITS) heuristic for static dial-a-ride problem (DARP) with the objective of obtaining high-quality solutions in short time. Two new techniques, initialization heuristic, and time window adjustment are proposed to achieve faster convergence to the global optimum.

Darboux frames, snakes, and superquadrics form the basis of this representation, and curvature consistency provides the computational framework The organization is hierarchical. Darboux frames are used to describe the local surface, whereas snakes are used to interpolate between features, particularly those that serve to partition a surface into its constituent parts. Superquadrics are subsequently used to characterize the 3-D shape of each surface partition. The result is a set of connected volumetric primitives that serve to describe the overall shape of an object.

abstract = {In urban areas, logistic transportation operations often run into problems because travel speeds change, depending on the current traffic situation. If not accounted for, time-dependent and stochastic travel speeds frequently lead to missed time windows and thus poorer service. Especially in the case of passenger transportation, it often leads to excessive passenger ride times as well. Therefore, time-dependent and stochastic influences on travel speeds are relevant for finding feasible and reliable solutions. This study considers the effect of exploiting statistical information available about historical accidents, using stochastic solution approaches for the dynamic dial-A-ride problem (dynamic DARP). The authors propose two pairs of metaheuristic solution approaches, each consisting of a deterministic method (average time-dependent travel speeds for planning) and its corresponding stochastic version (exploiting stochastic information while planning). The results, using test instances with up to 762 requests based on a real-world road network, show that in certain conditions, exploiting stochastic information about travel speeds leads to significant improvements over deterministic approaches. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this work we present the automatic localization of a wide variety of differently shaped objects scanned with a laser range sensor from one view in a cluttered setting. The daily-life objects are modeled using approximated superquadrics, which can be obtained from showing the object or another modeling process. Detection is based on a hierarchical RANSAC search to obtain fast detection results and the voting of sorted quality-of-fit criteria. The probabilistic search starts from low resolution and refines hypotheses at increasingly higher resolution levels. Criteria for object shape and the relationship of object parts together with a ranking procedure and a ranked voting process result in a combined ranking of hypothesis using a minimum number of parameters. Experiments from cluttered table top scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, feasible for real world object localization and robot grasp planning.},

While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-pointconvergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

A possible solution to this arising problem is to compute the best routes for each new scenario. In this problem, known in the literature as the dial-a-ride problem, a number of passengers are transported between pickup and delivery locations trying to minimize the routing costs while respecting a set of prespecified constraints. This problem has been solved in the literature with several approaches from small to medium sized problems. However, few efforts have dealt with large scale problems very common in massive scenarios (big cities or highly-populated regions). In this study, a new distributed algorithm based on the partition of the requests space and the combination of the routes is presented and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a large-scale problem (up to 16,000 requests or 32,000 locations) in the city of San Francisco. The results show that, not only the distributed algorithm is able to solve large problem instances that the corresponding sequential algorithm is unable to solve in a reasonable time, but also to have an average improvement of 9{\%} in the smaller problems. The results have been validated by means of statistical procedures proving that the distributed algorithm can be an effective way to solve high dimensional dial-a-ride problems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general method for exact distance computation between convex objects represented as intersections of implicit surfaces. Exact distance computation algorithms are particularly important for applications involving objects that make intermittent contact, such as in dynamic simulations and in haptic interactions. They can also be used in the narrow phase of hierarchical collision detection. In contrast to geometric approaches developed for polyhedral objects, we formulate the distance computation problem as a convex optimization problem. We use an interior point method to solve the optimization problem and demonstrate that, for general convex objects represented as implicit surfaces, interior point approaches are globally convergent, and fast in practice. Further, they provide polynomial-time guarantees for implicit surface objects when the implicit surfaces have self-concordant barrier functions. We use a primal-dual interior point algorithm that solves the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions obtained from the convex programming formulation. For the case of polyhedra and quadrics, we establish a theoretical time complexity of O(n{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1.5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), where n is the number of constraints. We present implementation results for example implicit surface objects, including polyhedra, quadrics, and generalizations of quadrics such as superquadrics and hyperquadrics, as well as intersections of these surfaces. We demonstrate that in practice, the algorithm takes time linear in the number of constraints, and that distance computation rates of about 1 kHz can be achieved. We also extend the approach to proximity queries between deforming convex objects. Finally, we show that continuous collision detection for linearly translating objects can be performed by solving two related convex optimization problems. For polyhedra and quadrics, we establish that the computational complexity of this problem is also O(n{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1.5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}).},

abstract = {The dial-a-ride problem with time windows (DARPTW) is a combinatorial optimization problem related to transportation, in which a set of customers must be picked up from an origin location and they have to be delivered to a destination location. A transportation schedule must be constructed for a set of available vehicles, and several constraints have to be considered, particularly time windows, which define an upper and lower time bound for each customer request in which a vehicle must arrive to perform the service. Because of the complexity of DARPTW, a number of algorithms have been proposed for solving the problem, mainly based on metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. In this work, a different approach for solving DARPTW is proposed, designed, and evaluated: hyperheuristics, which are alternative heuristic methods that operate at a higher abstraction level than metaheuristics, because rather than searching in the problem space directly, they search in a space of low-level heuristics to find the best strategy through which good solutions can be found. Although the proposed hyperheuristic uses simple and easy-to-implement operators, the experimental results demonstrate efficient and competitive performance on DARPTW when compared to other metaheuristics from the literature.},

First, we introduce a new numerically stable form of superquadric fitting. This is of interest for the application of superquadrics in general far beyond the concrete application scenario in this paper.

This model has 805K vertices and 1.6M triangles. In this scene with changing topologies, our novel collision detection algorithm based on a deforming filter increases the culling efficiency and reduces the number of elementary tests by 10x when compared to prior methods and improves the performance of the CCD algorithm by 4.1x. Abstract We present a novel culling algorithm that uses deforming non-penetration filters to improve the performance of continuous col-lision detection (CCD) algorithms. The underlying idea is to use a simple and effective filter that reduces both the number of false pos-itives and the elementary tests between the primitives. This filter is derived from the coplanarity condition and can be easily combined with other methods used to accelerate CCD. We have implemented the algorithm and tested its performance on many non-rigid simula-tions. In practice, we can reduce the number of false positives sig-nificantly and improve the overall performance of CCD algorithms by 1.5 − 8.2x.},

abstract = {Highly automated road vehicles need the capability of stopping safely in a situation that prevents continued nominal operation, e.g. due to internal system faults. Motion planning for safe stop is different from nominal motion planning, since there is not one specific goal location. Rather, the desired behavior is that the vehicle should end up in a stopped state, preferably outside of active lanes. Also, the functionality to stop safely needs to be of high integrity. In this paper, a safe stop optimal control problem is formulated, for which the solution trajectory captures the desired behavior for safe stop. It is subsequently used as a benchmark to evaluate a real-time capable algorithm for safe stop trajectory planning. The safe stop trajectory planning algorithm is based on selection from a precomputed trajectory set. By exploiting the particular properties of the safe stop problem, the cardinality of the set is decreased, making the algorithm computationally efficient. Furthermore, a monitoring based architecture concept is proposed, that ensures dependability of the safe stop function. Finally, a proof of concept simulation of the architecture and the safe stop maneuver planner is presented.},

abstract = {In this paper, an online regret based dial-a-ride (OR-DARP) algorithm is introduced and its performance evaluated on an actual demand responsive transit (DRT) system. The innovative part of the algorithm is the design of the optimization engine. A signal communication scheme between the trip dispatcher and the algorithm is used to improve utilization of the available idle time that can then be devoted to the optimization engine. The basic concept is as follows: a. Every trip request is treated as an emergency request demanding an immediate answer, b. The optimization engine runs continuously, thereby consuming every idle time fragment unless interrupted by a new trip request. The trip data are real, and they are sourced from a DRT system operating at a municipality in northern Greece where a static dial-a-ride algorithm was used as the optimization engine. Given the fact that these trips data provide all trip details plus the show-up time (the most important feature for our study), these data are the ideal basis for an "a posteriori" evaluation of the proposed online approach. Another contribution of this paper is the identification of the critical parameters in the trade-off between benefits gained from continuing to optimize an online system versus the losses of non-served demands. This important issue when applying online algorithms has not been studied extensively in the literature so far (to the best of our knowledge).},

The objective of this paper is to fill this gap. Specifically, this paper presents a bi-directional, sampling-based, asymptotically-optimal algorithm named Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to bi-directional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMT* performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in cost-to-come space from the initial configuration and another in cost-to-go space from the goal configuration. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of BFMT* over its unidirectional counterpart, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art planners.},

abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms, e.g., in terms of a given cost function, have been established so far. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by designing efficient incremental sampling-based algorithms with provable optimality properties. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path returned by RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value, as the number of samples increases. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path returned by RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called RRT * , which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT * algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

abstract = {Magnetic tapes have been playing a key role as means for storage of digital data for decades, and their unsurpassed cost-effectiveness still make them the technology of choice in several industries, such as media and entertainment. Tapes are mostly used for cold storage nowadays, and therefore the study of scheduling algorithms for read requests tailored for these devices has been largely neglected in the literature. In this article, we investigate the Linear Tape Scheduling Problem (LTSP), in which read requests associated with files stored on a single-tracked magnetic tape should be scheduled in a way that the sum of all response times are minimized. LTSP has many similarities with classical combinatorial optimization problems such as the Traveling Repairmen Problem and the Dial-a-Ride Problem restricted to the real line; nevertheless, significant differences on structural properties and strict time-limit constraints of real-world scenarios make LTSP challenging and interesting on its own. In this work, we investigate several properties and algorithms for LTSP and some of its extensions. The results allowed for the identification of 3-approximation algorithms for LTSP and efficient exact algorithms for some of its special cases. We also show that LTSPR, the version of the problem with heterogeneous release times for requests, is NP-complete. OLTSP, the online extension of LTSPR, does not admit c-competitive algorithms for any constant factor c, but we nevertheless introduce an algorithm for the problem and show through extensive computational experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that different embodiments of the proposed strategy are computationally efficient and over-perform by orders of magnitude an algorithm being currently used by real-world tape file systems.},

abstract = {A method for approximating an object's surface defined by 2.5D data is presented. The goal is to determine a compact volume which may be subjected to manipulation actions under a proper grasp planning. The object volume is obtained based on a union of parameterized geometric shapes, also known as superquadrics. In order to reduce over-segmentations and also the number of fitting combinations, the object space is defined as a 3D bounding Region of Interest (ROI). Further, via voxel decomposition, the ROI is decomposed in more meaningful smaller ROIs that can capture a large number of features from the object of interest. By using a fixed size voxel grid, the process can be slowed down for the cases of large objects. A boosting speedup of the process is proposed through dynamically adjusting the sides of the voxels for each object. Finally, a method for voxels merging is proposed. Each of the newly created ROIs, related to a particular region of the object, will be hosting a superquadric model which optimally estimates the considered surface.},

Given the fact that people are subject to transportation, constraints related to quality of service are usually present, such as time windows and maximum user ride time limits. In many real world applications, different types of users exist. In the field of patient and disabled people transportation, up to four different transportation modes can be distinguished. In this article we consider staff seats, patient seats, stretchers and wheelchair places. Furthermore, most companies involved in the transportation of the disabled or ill dispose of different types of vehicles. We introduce both aspects into state-of-the-art formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms for the standard dial-a-ride problem. Also a recent metaheuristic method is adapted to this new problem. In addition, a further service quality related issue is analyzed: vehicle waiting time with passengers aboard. Instances with up to 40 requests are solved to optimality.

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for contact detection between convex quadric surfaces using its implicit equations. With some small modifications in the equations, one can model superellipsoids, superhyperboloids of one or two sheets and supertoroids. This methodology is to be implemented on a multibody dynamics code, in order to simulate the interpenetration between mechanical systems, particularly, the simulation of collisions with motor vehicles and other road users, such as cars, motorcycles and pedestrians.The contact detection of two bodies is formulated as a convex nonlinear constrained optimization problem that is solved using two methods, an Interior Point method (IP) and a Sequential Quadratic Programming method (SQP), coded in MATLAB and FORTRAN environment, respectively. The objective function to be minimized is the distance between both surfaces. The design constraints are the implicit superquadrics surfaces equations and operations between its normal vectors and the distance itself. The contact points or the points that minimize the distance between the surfaces are the design variables. Computational efficiency can be improved by using Bounding Volumes in contact detection pre-steps. First one approximate the geometry using spheres, and then Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB).Results show that the optimization technique suits for the accurate contact detection between objects modelled by implicit superquadric equations., Detekcja kontaktu pomi{\c{e}}dzy wypuk{\l}ymi powierzchniami kawadratowymiW artykule przedstawiono metodologi{\c{e}} wykrywania kontaktu mi{\c{e}}dzy wypuk{\l}ymi powierzchniami typu kwadryki (superkwadratowych) opisanych r{\'{o}}wnaniami uwik{\l}anymi.

An efficient algorithm is initially proposed for decomposing the complex objects into subobjects suitable for superquadric modeling, based on visual salience and curvature constraints. The distance between the superquadrics and the mesh is then projected onto the superquadric surface, thus generating a distance map (SQ-Map). Approximate collision detection is then performed by computing the analytical equations and distance maps instead of triangle per triangle intersection tests. Collision response is then calculated directly from the superquadric models and realistic smooth force feedback is obtained using analytical formulae and local smoothing on the distance map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SQ-Map reduces significantly the computational cost when compared to accurate collision detection methods and does not require the huge amounts of memory demanded by distance field-based methods. Finally, force feedback is calculated directly from the distance map and the superquadric formulae.},

Large cities are demanding more and more share transportation services with flexible routes, resulting from user dynamic demands. In this study a new algorithm is proposed for solving the problem of computing the best routes that a public transportation company could offer to satisfy a number of customer requests. In this problem, known in the literature as the dial-a-ride problem, a number of passengers has to be transported between pickup and delivery locations trying to minimize the routing costs while respecting a set of pre-specified constraints (maximum pickup time, maximum ride duration and maximum load per vehicle). For optimizing this problem, a new variable neighborhood search has been developed and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a large-scale dial-a-ride problem in the city of San Francisco. The results have been compared against two state-of-the-art algorithms of the literature and validated by means of statistical procedures proving that the new algorithm has obtained the best overall results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, another task with low-priority is considered to track the target object. The main advantages of the proposed approach are low computational cost, robustness and fully utilization of the allowed space for the constraints. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation results for a simple 2D case and a complex 3D case study.

abstract = {Verified distance computation is an important task in various application domains. In some domains a proof of correctness is crucial. In this paper, we show how we can apply the methods provided by our uniform framework for verified geometric computations to derive verified bounds on the distance between non-convex objects. The framework features a layered structure enabling the algorithm to run independently whether the objects are described by implicit functions or parametric ones or by polyhedrons. The approach is based on the use of adaptively constructed hierarchical decompositions of the models. As a practical example we use various scenarios occurring in automatic surgery assistance systems for total hip replacement (THR). To ensure that an implant selected by the system fits into the patient's femoral shaft, we have to derive verified bounds on the distance between them. In this case, the models are either superquadrics or polyhedrons, both of which can be non-convex We first show how to increase the enclosure quality of implicit objects by incorporating interval contractors into the hierarchical space decomposition. Next, we describe the construction of a decomposition structure for parametric objects. After that, we present an improvement of the case selector for computing the distance between interval tree nodes, yielding tighter results. We also show how to integrate surface normals into the algorithm if first-order information is available and how to accelerate the solving process by incorporating information gained by non-verified floating-point solvers. Finally, we provide numerical results for all distance query types occurring during the THR procedure and examine whether it is advisable to perform the computation on the implicit model or on the parametric one if both are available. Further numerical results are presented for test cases involving contractors in the decomposition structures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {On-demand transport services in the form of dial-a-ride and taxis are crucial parts of the transport infrastructure in all major cities. However, not all on-demand transport services are equal: not-for-profit dial-a-ride services with coordinated drivers significantly differ from profit-motivated taxi services with uncoordinated drivers. In fact, there are two key threads of work on efficient scheduling, routing, and pricing for passengers: dial-a-ride services; and taxi services. Unfortunately, there has been only limited development of algorithms for joint optimization of scheduling, routing, and pricing; largely due to the widespread assumption of fixed pricing. In this paper, we introduce another thread: profit-motivated on-demand transport services with coordinated drivers. To maximize provider profits and the efficiency of the service, we propose a new market mechanism for this new thread of on-demand transport services, where passengers negotiate with the service provider. In contrast to previous work, our mechanism jointly optimizes scheduling, routing, and pricing. Ultimately, we demonstrate that our approach can lead to higher profits and reduced passenger prices, compared with standard fixed price approaches, while also improving efficiency.},

abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to find an objects representation scheme with high precision and to compute the objects' separation distance effectively in final analysis. Proximity queries have been used widely in robot trajectory planning, automatic assembly planning, virtual surgery and many other applications. The core of proximity query is the precise computation of (minimum) separation distance in narrow phase, and specific object representation scheme corresponds to different methods of separation distance computation. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based (minimum) separation distance computation algorithm was proposed. It treats convex superquadrics, descriptive primitives of complex object as the study objects. The separation distance between two convex superquadrics was written as a general nonlinear programming (NLP) problem with superquadric constraints and then transformed into an SOCP problem with the method of conic formulation of superquadric constraints. Finally, a primal-dual interior point method embedded in MOSEK was used for solving the SOCP problem. Findings - The proposed algorithm achieved exact separation distance computation between convex superquadrics, with a relative error of 10-6. It is particularly suitable for proximity queries in narrow phase of static collision detection algorithms. Further, the proposed algorithm achieved continuous collision detection between rectilinear translation superquadrics. Originality/value - The proposed algorithm in narrow phase of static collision detection algorithms makes objects' separation distance effectively computed. Proximity queries are easy and more accurate to perform in this way.},

In high dimensions it is essential that learning does not plan uniformly over a state-space. Parti-game maintains a decision-tree partitioning of state-space and applies techniques from game-theory and computational geometry to efficiently and adaptively concentrate high resolution only on critical areas. The current version of the algorithm is designed to find feasible paths or trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional spaces. Future versions will be designed to find a solution that optimizes a real-valued criterion. Many simululated problems have been tested, ranging from two-dimensional to nine-dimensional state-spaces, including mazes, path planning, non-linear dynamics, and planar snake robots in restricted spaces. In all cases, a good solution is found in less than ten trials and a few minutes.},

abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms for path planning have achieved great success during the last 15 years, thanks to their ability to efficiently solve complex high-dimensional problems. However, standard versions of these algorithms cannot guarantee optimality or even high-quality for the produced paths. In recent years, variants of these methods, taking cost criteria into account during the exploration process, have been proposed to compute high-quality paths (such as T-RRT), some even guaranteeing asymptotic optimality (such as RRT*). In this paper, we propose two new sampling-based approaches that combine the underlying principles of RRT* and T-RRT. These algorithms, called T-RRT* and AT-RRT, offer probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality guarantees. Results presented on several classes of problems show that they converge faster than RRT* toward the optimal path, especially when the topology of the search space is complex and/or when its dimensionality is high.},

abstract = {The main topic of this thesis is model predictive control (mpc) of an unstable fighter aircraft. When flying it is important to be able to reach, but not exceed the aircraft limitations and to consider the physical boundaries on the control signals. mpc is a method for controlling a system while considering constraints on states and control signals by formulating it as an optimization problem. The drawback with mpc is the computational time needed and because of that, it is primarily developed for systems with a slowly varying dynamics. Two different methods are chosen to speed up the process by making simplifi- cations, approximations and exploiting the structure of the problem. The first method is an explicit method, performing most of the calculations offline. By solving the optimization problem for a number of data sets and thereafter train- ing a neural network, it can be treated as a simpler function solved online. The second method is called fast mpc, in this case the entire optimization is done on- line. It uses Cholesky decomposition, backward-forward substitution and warm start to decrease the complexity and calculation time of the program. Both methods perform reference tracking by solving an underdetermined system by minimizing the weighted norm of the control signals. Integral control is also implemented by using a Kalman filter to observe constant disturbances. An im- plementation was made in matlab for a discrete time linear model and in ares, a simulation tool used at Saab Aeronautics, with a more accurate nonlinear model. The result is a neural network function computed in tenth of a millisecond, a time independent of the size of the prediction horizon. The size of the fast mpc problem is however directly affected by the horizon and the computational time will never be as small, but it can be reduced to a couple of milliseconds at the cost of optimality.},

We show that an heuristic search focused on assignment decisions with a systematic optimal choice of sequences (using Concorde TSP solver) during each move evaluation is promising but requires a prohibitive computational effort. We therefore introduce an intermediate search space, based on the dynamic programming procedure of Balas {\&} Simonetti, which finds a good compromise between intensification and computational efficiency. A variety of speed-up techniques are proposed for a fast exploration: neighborhood reductions, dynamic move filters, memory structures, and concatenation techniques. Finally, a tunneling strategy is designed to reshape the search space as the algorithm progresses. The combination of these techniques within a classical local search, as well as in the unified hybrid genetic search (UHGS) leads to significant improvements of solution accuracy. New best solutions are found for surprisingly small instances with as few as 256 customers. These solutions had not been attained up to now with classic neighborhoods. Overall, this research permits to better evaluate the respective impact of sequence and assignment optimization, proposes new ways of combining the optimization of these two decision sets, and opens promising research perspectives for the CVRP and its variants.},

Hence to improve the convergence rate, its bidirectional variants were introduced, the Bi-directional RRT* (B-RRT*) and Intelligent Bi-directional RRT* (IB-RRT*). However, as both variants perform pure exploration, they tend to suffer in highly cluttered environments.

abstract = {Ridesharing is an important component of sustainable urban transportation as it increases vehicle utilization while reducing road utilization. By sharing rides, drivers offer free seats in their vehicles to passengers who want to travel in similar directions. Traditional ridesharing approaches are suitable for long-distance travel, especially inter-city travel, yet they are not flexible enough for short routes within cities. The aim of our research is to develop a service that enables dynamic ridesharing as part of sustainable urban mobility. Dynamic ridesharing refers to a service that automatically matches ride requests and ride offers on short notice without prior agreement between driver and passenger. We present the implementation and evaluation of a dynamic ridesharing service. The implementation part requires an automated matching algorithm that checks whether a driver can take a passenger with him without violating the maximum detour constraint he has set. As this matching algorithm needs to automatically match a relatively large number of ride offers and ride requests in real-time, we focused on building a high-performance algorithm. After implementing the algorithm, we evaluated its performance on a data set with random ride offers in and around the Munich city that is matched with different ride requests. For 10,000 rides in the system, it took less than 0.4 seconds on average to identify the best match.},

abstract = {This paper presents two visual trackers from the different paradigms of learning and registration based tracking and evaluates their application in image based visual servoing. They can track object motion with four degrees of freedom (DoF) which, as we will show here, is sufficient for many fine manipulation tasks. One of these trackers is a newly developed learning based tracker that relies on learning discriminative correlation filters while the other is a refinement of a recent 8 DoF RANSAC based tracker adapted with a new appearance model for tracking 4 DoF motion. Both trackers are shown to provide superior performance to several state of the art trackers on an existing dataset for manipulation tasks. Further, a new dataset with challenging sequences for fine manipulation tasks captured from robot mounted eye-in-hand (EIH) cameras is also presented. These sequences have a variety of challenges encountered during real tasks including jittery camera movement, motion blur, drastic scale changes and partial occlusions. Quantitative and qualitative results on these sequences are used to show that these two trackers are robust to failures while providing high precision that makes them suitable for such fine manipulation tasks.},

Experiments demonstrate that our planner finds a fast initial path and decreases the cost of this path iteratively. We identify and address the limitations of RRT* in high-dimensional configuration spaces. We introduce a sampling bias to facilitate and accelerate cost decrease in these spaces and a simple node-rejection criteria to increase efficiency. Finally, we incorporate an existing bi-directional approach to search which decreases the time to find an initial path. We analyze our planner on a simple 2D navigation problem in detail to show its properties and test it on a difficult 7D manipulation problem to show its effectiveness. Our results consistently demonstrate improved performance over RRT*. I.},

abstract = {Fast and efficient motion planning algorithms are crucial for many state-of-the-art robotics applications such as self-driving cars. Existing motion planning methods such as RRT*, A*, and D*, become ineffective as their computational complexity increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the motion planning problem. To address this issue, we present a neural network-based novel planning algorithm which generates end-to-end collision-free paths irrespective of the obstacles' geometry. The proposed method, called MPNet (Motion Planning Network), comprises of a Contractive Autoencoder which encodes the given workspaces directly from a point cloud measurement, and a deep feedforward neural network which takes the workspace encoding, start and goal configuration, and generates end-to-end feasible motion trajectories for the robot to follow. We evaluate MPNet on multiple planning problems such as planning of a point-mass robot, rigid-body, and 7 DOF Baxter robot manipulators in various 2D and 3D environments. The results show that MPNet is not only consistently computationally efficient in all 2D and 3D environments but also show remarkable generalization to completely unseen environments. The results also show that computation time of MPNet consistently remains less than 1 second which is significantly lower than existing state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms. Furthermore, through transfer learning, the MPNet trained in one scenario (e.g., indoor living places) can also quickly adapt to new scenarios (e.g., factory floors) with a little amount of data.},

The objective is to regulate the relative position and yaw of the vehicle to a planar target consisting of multiple points using a minimal sensor set, i.e., an inertial measurement unit and a vision sensor. A set of first order image moment features, defined in the image plane of a virtual camera with zero roll and pitch motion, is used for visual servoing. It has been observed in previous work that various system uncertainties, such as aerodynamics constants and attitude estimation bias, result in steady-state errors if not being compensated. By treating those uncertainties as unknown system parameters, an adaptive backstepping controller is developed. As the given visual servoing law is an output feedback controller, the translational velocity measurement from the global position system is not required. The asymptotic stability of the error dynamics is proven. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the controller performance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To provide an integrated visualisation of intraoperative ultrasound and endoscopic images to facilitate intraoperative guidance, real-time tracking of the ultrasound probe is required. State-of-the-art methods are suitable for planar targets while most of the laparoscopic ultrasound probes are cylindrical objects. A tracking framework for cylindrical objects with a large work space will improve the usability of the intraoperative ultrasound guidance. METHODS A hybrid marker design that combines circular dots and chessboard vertices is proposed for facilitating tracking cylindrical tools. The circular dots placed over the curved surface are used for pose estimation. The chessboard vertices are employed to provide additional information for resolving the ambiguous pose problem due to the use of planar model points under a monocular camera. Furthermore, temporal information between consecutive images is considered to minimise tracking failures with real-time computational performance. RESULTS Detailed validation confirms that our hybrid marker provides a large working space for different tool sizes (6-14 mm in diameter). The tracking framework allows translational movements between 40 and 185 mm along the depth direction and rotational motion around three local orthogonal axes up to [Formula: see text]. Comparative studies with the current state of the art confirm that our approach outperforms existing methods by providing nearly 100{\%} detection rates and accurate pose estimation with mean errors of 2.8 mm and 0.72[Formula: see text]. The tracking algorithm runs at 20 frames per second for [Formula: see text] image resolution videos. CONCLUSION Experiments show that the proposed hybrid marker can be applied to a wide range of surgical tools with superior detection rates and pose estimation accuracies. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our framework can be used not only for assisting intraoperative ultrasound guidance but also for tracking general surgical tools in MIS.},

abstract = {This paper deals with a combinatorial optimization problem that models situations of both dynamic ride-sharing and taxi-sharing. Passengers who want to share a taxi or a ride, use an app to specify their current location, destination and further information such as the earliest departure time, the latest arrival time and the maximum cost they are willing to pay for the ride. Car owners also specify their origin, destination, the leaving time and the maximum accepted delay. Taxi drivers report their location and the time they will start and end the service. All drivers need to define a price per kilometer. The problem is to compute routes, matching requests to vehicles in such a way that ride-sharing is allowed as long as some restrictions are satisfied, such as: the capacity of the vehicle, maximum trip cost of each passenger and maximum delay. The problem is dynamic since new requests arrive on-line and routes can be modified in order to attend them. To solve this dynamic problem, the day is divided in time periods. For each period, an instance of a static problem is created and solved by a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Experiments with instances based on real data were made to evaluate the heuristics and the proposed method. In our simulations with taxis, passengers paid, on average, almost 30{\%} less than they would pay on private rides. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Our technique is based on a hypothesis generation and refinement scheme. The vertices of the piled objects are extracted and superquadric seeds are aligned at these vertices. The model parameter recovery task is decomposed into two subproblems, each dealing with a subset of the model's parameter set. Both region and boundary based information sources are used for parameter estimation. Compared to a widespread strategy for superquadric recovery, our method shows advantages in terms of robustness and computational efficiency. In addition, our system exhibits versatility with regard to existing industrial systems, since it can effectively deal with both neatly placed and jumbled configurations of objects.},

The idea of our approach is to segment the image in two layers: the pixels which match our optical flow model and those that do not (i.e. the obstacles). In this paper, we focus our approach on a model of the motion of the ground plane. Regions of the visual field that violate this model indicate potential obstacles. In the first part of this paper, we describe the method we used to determine our model of the ground plane's motion. Then we focus on the method to match both the model and the real optical flow field. Experiments have been carried on the Cycab mobile robot in real-time on a standard PC laptop},

abstract = {Obstacle detection and collision avoidance capabilities are the cornerstone of service robotic manipulators, i.e., robots that can work safely in human environments. Though algorithms and methods for collision avoidance already exist, they usually rely on complete CAD models of the environment. Such model are difficult to obtain from dynamic environments involving persons moving in unpredictable ways, thus reactive behaviors based on real-time sensing seems to be a more appropriate solution. This paper presents a prototype of the sensing skin for a robot arm. Rings of sensors are arranged around the robot links, each ring consisting of several infrared range sensors, which can detect objects in a distance range of between 4 and 30 cm, with less influence on the color of reflected obstacles. The resulting array of sensor measurements is fed up into a reinforcement learning scheme whose outputs are motion command for the robot joints. The system is intended to learn in an autonomous way the motions to avoid collisions with surrounding objects in real-time.},

abstract = {Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) has increasingly gained popularity and has been adopted in applications such as industrial robots, quadrotors, and unmanned aerial vehicles. When exploiting IBVS, the image feature velocity command obtained from the visual loop controller is converted to the velocity command of the workspace through the interaction matrix so as to converge image feature error. However, issues such as the noise/disturbance arising from image processing and the smoothness of image feature command are often overlooked in the design of the visual loop controller, especially in a contour following task. In particular, noise in the image feature will contaminate the image feedback signal so that the visual loop performance can be substantially affected. To cope with the aforementioned problem, this article employs the sliding mode controller to suppress the adverse effects caused by image feature noise. Moreover, by exploiting the idea of motion planning, a parametric curve interpolator is developed to generate smooth image feature commands. In addition, a depth observer is also designed to provide the depth information essential in the implementation of the interaction matrix. In order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach, a two-degrees-of-freedom planar robot that employs an IBVS structure and an eye-to-hand camera configuration is used to conduct a contour following task. Contour following results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Using the iterated local search framework, the heuristic combines tabu search with a simple perturbation mechanism to ensure a broad exploration of the search space.

The proposed algorithm makes use of the bees algorithm for minimizing a predefined cost function in order to find the best input signals subject to constraints and a model of the system. The class of systems considered in this paper includes autonomous nonlinear systems without delay and with continuous and discrete inputs. The proposed algorithm is validated by simulating a three tank system as a case study. A comparison between the proposed novel MPC with different predictive horizons and a conventional MPC demonstrates the potential advantages of the proposed method such as reduction in computation time, good convergence toward desired values and ability of control management. Simulations also show the simplicity of applying and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for designing an MPC based on the bees algorithm.},

abstract = {Using a single sensor to determine the pose estimation of a device cannot give accurate results. This paper presents a fusion of an inertial sensor of six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) which comprises the 3-axis of an accelerometer and the 3-axis of a gyroscope, and a vision to determine a low-cost and accurate position for an autonomous mobile robot. For vision, a monocular vision-based object detection algorithm speeded-up robust feature (SURF) and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithms were integrated and used to recognize a sample object in several images taken. As against the conventional method that depend on point-tracking, RANSAC uses an iterative method to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model from a set of captured data which contains outliers. With SURF and RANSAC, improved accuracy is certain; this is because of their ability to find interest points (features) under different viewing conditions using a Hessain matrix. This approach is proposed because of its simple implementation, low cost, and improved accuracy. With an extended Kalman filter (EKF), data from inertial sensors and a camera were fused to estimate the position and orientation of the mobile robot. All these sensors were mounted on the mobile robot to obtain an accurate localization. An indoor experiment was carried out to validate and evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is fast in computation, reliable and robust, and can be considered for practical applications. The performance of the experiments was verified by the ground truth data and root mean square errors (RMSEs).},

abstract = {Humans are remarkably proficient at controlling their limbs and tools from a wide range of viewpoints and angles, even in the presence of optical distortions. In robotics, this ability is referred to as visual servoing: moving a tool or end-point to a desired location using primarily visual feedback. In this paper, we study how viewpoint-invariant visual servoing skills can be learned automatically in a robotic manipulation scenario. To this end, we train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine which actions move the end-point of a robotic arm to a desired object. The problem that must be solved by this controller is fundamentally ambiguous: under severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the actions in a single feedforward operation. Instead, our visual servoing system must use its memory of past movements to understand how the actions affect the robot motion from the current viewpoint, correcting mistakes and gradually moving closer to the target. This ability is in stark contrast to most visual servoing methods, which either assume known dynamics or require a calibration phase. We show how we can learn this recurrent controller using simulated data and a reinforcement learning objective. We then describe how the resulting model can be transferred to a real-world robot by disentangling perception from control and only adapting the visual layers. The adapted model can servo to previously unseen objects from novel viewpoints on a real-world Kuka IIWA robotic arm.

abstract = {Challenges persist in nonholonomic robot navigation in dynamic environments. This paper presents a framework for such navigation based on the model of generalized velocity obstacles (GVO). The idea of velocity obstacles has been well studied and developed for obstacle avoidance since being proposed in 1998. Though it has been proved to be successful, most studies have assumed equations of motion to be linear, which limits their application to holonomic robots. In addition, more attention has been paid to the immediate reaction of robots, while advance planning has been neglected. By applying the GVO model to differential drive robots and by combining it with RRT*, we reduce the uncertainty of the robot trajectory, thus further reducing the range of concern, and save both computation time and running time. By introducing uncertainty for the dynamic obstacles with a Kalman filter, we dilute the risk of considering the obstacles as uniformly moving along a straight line and guarantee the safety. Special concern is given to path generation, including curvature check, making the generated path feasible for nonholonomic robots. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the framework.},

Based only on onboard sensing and 3D point cloud processing, it approximates objects using swept-sphere-volumes while the robot is moving. It does not rely on color or any previous models or information. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by testing it on our human-sized biped robot Lola, which is able to avoid moving obstacles in real-time while walking at a set speed of 0.4m/s and performing whole-body collision avoidance.},

Superquadrics refer to a family of shapes: here we deal with the superellipsoids and superparaboloids. Due to the strong non-linearities involved in the equations, uniform or close-to-uniform sampling is not attainable through a naive approach of direct sampling from the parametric formulation. This is specially true for more `cubic' superquadrics (with shape parameters close to {\$}0.1{\$}). We extend a previous solution of 2D close-to-uniform uniform sampling of superellipses to the superellipsoid (3D) case and derive our own for the superparaboloid. Additionally, we are able to provide normals for each sampled point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete approach for close-to-uniform sampling of superellipsoids and superparaboloids in one single framework. We present derivations, pseudocode and qualitative and quantitative results using our code, which is available online.},

abstract = {Cloud Robotics is a paradigm where distributed robots are connected to cloud services via networks to access unlimited computation power, at the cost of network communication. However, due to limitations such as network latency and variability, it is difficult to control dynamic, human compliant service robots directly from the cloud. In this work, by leveraging asynchronous protocol with a heartbeat signal, we combine cloud robotics with a smart edge device to build a Fog Robotic system. We use the system to enable robust teleoperation of a dynamic self-balancing robot from the cloud. We first use the system to pick up boxes from static locations, a task commonly performed in warehouse logistics. To make cloud teleoperation more efficient, we deploy image based visual servoing (IBVS) to perform box pickups automatically. Visual feedbacks, including apriltag recognition and tracking, are performed in the cloud to emulate a Fog Robotic object recognition system for IBVS. We demonstrate the feasibility of real-time dynamic automation system using this cloud-edge hybrid, which opens up possibilities of deploying dynamic robotic control with deep-learning recognition systems in Fog Robotics. Finally, we show that Fog Robotics enables the self-balancing service robot to pick up a box automatically from a person under unstructured environments.},

abstract = {—Collision detection is of paramount importance for many applications in computer graphics and visualization. Typically, the input to a collision detection algorithm is a large number of geometric objects comprising an environment, together with a set of objects moving within the environment. In addition to determining accurately the contacts that occur between pairs of objects, one needs also to do so at real-time rates. Applications such as haptic force-feedback can require over 1,000 collision queries per second. In this paper, we develop and analyze a method, based on bounding-volume hierarchies, for efficient collision detection for objects moving within highly complex environments. Our choice of bounding volume is to use a “discrete orientation polytope” (“k-dop”), a convex polytope whose facets are determined by halfspaces whose outward normals come from a small fixed set of k orientations. We compare a variety of methods for constructing hierarchies (“BV-trees”) of bounding k-dops. Further, we propose algorithms for maintaining an effective BV-tree of k-dops for moving objects, as they rotate, and for performing fast collision detection using BV-trees of the moving objects and of the environment. Our algorithms have been implemented and tested. We provide experimental evidence showing that our approach yields substantially faster collision detection than previous methods.},

Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called "Divide-and-Conquer"), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks.

Because of the specific kinematic model of the arm, path planning can be first reduced to a redundant 6-DOF problem in a 5D configuration space, which can be further decomposed into two problems: (i) 3D position planning in Cartesian space and (ii) planning in a 3D space composed of two orientation angles and an explicit parameterization of the arms redundancy. Position and orientation planning are interweaving and performed “on-the- fly” without explicit global knowledge of the environment using two instances of the dynamic wave expansion neural network (DWENN), an effective method for path generation in arbitrarily changing environments. The dynamic and explorative nature of the DWENN algorithm allows to treat stationary and dynamic obstacles in a unified manner. Through a number of simulative tests, we show that the planner is capable of reaching both a satisfactory robustness level and real-time performance, as required by many practical applications.},

When obstacles or other kinodynamic constraints complicate the feedback design process, motion planning techniques can often still find feasible paths, but these techniques are typically implemented in the high-dimensional configuration (or state) space. Here we argue that providing a Voronoi bias in the task space can dramatically improve the performance of randomized motion planners, while still avoiding non-trivial constraints in the configuration (or state) space. We demonstrate the potential of task-space search by planning collision-free trajectories for a 1500 link arm through obstacles to reach a desired end-effector position. I.},

First, we trace how samplingbased motion planning has developed. We then discuss a variety of important issues for sampling-based motion planning, including uniform and regular sampling, topological issues, and search philosophies.

A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of surface vessels has been used for the controller design. It is assumed that the surface vessels are under-actuated and obstacles are present in the vessels' work environment. The real-time optimization abilities of the NMPC method has been used to improve the response of the unactuated DOF of the vessels and to directly incorporate the local obstacle avoidance into the formation control eliminating the need for an external local obstacle avoidance algorithm. This leads to more effective obstacle avoidance decisions based on the dynamics of the vehicle. The effectiveness the developed control law, even in the presence of model uncertainty and external disturbances are demonstrated via computer simulations.},

Restricted to the real line, online Dial-a-Ride captures natural problems like controlling a personal elevator. Tight results in terms of competitive ratios are known for the general setting and for online TSP on the line (where source and target of each request coincide). In contrast, online Dial-a-Ride on the line has resisted tight analysis so far, even though it is a very natural online problem. We conduct a tight competitive analysis of the Smartstart algorithm that gave the best known results for the general, metric case. In particular, our analysis yields a new upper bound of 2.94 for open, non-preemptive online Dial-a-Ride on the line, which improves the previous bound of 3.41 [Krumke'00]. The best known lower bound remains 2.04 [SODA'17].

abstract = {This paper presents a model predictive approach for obstacle avoidance of car-like unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). An optimal tracking problem while avoiding obstacles in unknown environments is formulated in terms of cost minimization under constraints. Information on obstacles can be incorporated online in the nonlinear model predictive framework and kinematic constraints are treated by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. The overall problem is solved real-time with nonlinear programming. This approach is applied to car-like robots including tire models while explicitly considering the dimension of the UGV rather than treating it as a dimensionless cart model. Two kinds of potential-like terms are employed in the cost function for obstacles avoidance. The first term is to consider the distance between the UGV and the obstacle, and the second one is to consider the parallax information of the UGV about the obstacles. Simulation results show that both two approaches can make safe steering in a simple environment, but in a complex environment such as an urban area, the approach based on the modified parallax (MP) was more successful in the view of the computation time and safe steering.
